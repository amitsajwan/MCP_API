# Answers to Your Questions

## 1. "It says client not connected use the async with client"

**✅ FIXED!** I've updated both FastMCP clients to support the `async with client` pattern.

### What I Fixed:

1. **Added async context manager methods** to both client classes:
   - `async def __aenter__(self)` - automatically connects when entering the context
   - `async def __aexit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb)` - automatically disconnects when exiting

2. **Updated the main functions** to demonstrate proper usage with `async with client`

3. **Created examples** showing the correct pattern

### How to Use It Now:

```python
import asyncio
from mcp_client_fastmcp import FastMCPClientWrapper

async def main():
    # ✅ CORRECT: Use async context manager
    async with FastMCPClientWrapper() as client:
        print("✅ Client automatically connected!")
        
        # Use the client
        tools = await client.list_tools()
        result = await client.process_query("Show me my data")
        
    # ✅ Client automatically disconnects here

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

### Before vs After:

**❌ Before (Manual management):**
```python
client = FastMCPClientWrapper()
await client.connect()  # Manual connection
# ... use client ...
await client.disconnect()  # Manual disconnection
```

**✅ After (Automatic management):**
```python
async with FastMCPClientWrapper() as client:
    # ... use client ...
# Automatic connection and disconnection
```

## 2. "Do I need to start MCP server separately?"

**✅ NO!** You do NOT need to start the MCP server separately.

### How It Works:

1. **Automatic Server Management**: When you use `async with client`, the client automatically:
   - Starts the MCP server process in the background
   - Connects to it via stdio transport
   - Manages the entire connection lifecycle
   - Automatically shuts down the server when done

2. **Server Process**: The client spawns a subprocess running:
   - `mcp_server_fastmcp.py --transport stdio` (for FastMCPClientWrapper)
   - `fastmcp_chatbot_server.py --transport stdio` (for FastMCPChatbotClient)

3. **Cleanup**: When the `async with` block exits, the client automatically:
   - Disconnects from the server
   - Terminates the server process
   - Cleans up all resources

### Example:

```python
async with FastMCPClientWrapper() as client:
    # Server is automatically started and connected
    # You can use the client immediately
    tools = await client.list_tools()
    
# Server is automatically stopped and cleaned up
```

## Files I Updated:

1. **`mcp_client_fastmcp.py`** - Added async context manager support
2. **`fastmcp_chatbot_client.py`** - Added async context manager support
3. **`example_async_with_client.py`** - Created comprehensive example
4. **`simple_async_example.py`** - Created simple demonstration
5. **`README_ASYNC_WITH_CLIENT.md`** - Created detailed documentation

## Benefits of the Fix:

✅ **Automatic Connection Management**: No more "client not connected" errors
✅ **Error-Safe**: Resources are cleaned up even if exceptions occur
✅ **Cleaner Code**: Less boilerplate, more readable
✅ **Server Lifecycle**: Server is automatically managed
✅ **No Manual Server Startup**: Everything is handled automatically

## Test It:

Run the simple example to see the pattern in action:
```bash
python3 simple_async_example.py
```

## Summary:

- ✅ **Fixed**: Both clients now support `async with client` pattern
- ✅ **No separate server startup needed**: Everything is automatic
- ✅ **Error-safe**: Resources are always cleaned up
- ✅ **Easy to use**: Just use `async with client` and you're done!

The "client not connected" error should no longer occur when using the `async with client` pattern, and you don't need to start the MCP server separately - it's all handled automatically!
